# Preface

Compared to common blog frameworks (such as `hexo`, `wordpress`, etc.), which are easy for beginners to set up by following the documentation, they may be less suitable for those who want to customize their blogs. Making small customizations, like adding animations, a comment system, or traffic monitoring, within these frameworks can be cumbersome, and building your own blog might be a more straightforward solution. Hence, this blog project is born.

# Features

- ⚡ **Fast**: Built with `Next.js`, providing fast initial loading, seamless route transitions, and article preloading. Article CRUD operations are done locally through a `CLI` for convenience.
- 🌱 **Simple**: Purely frontend-based, no backend knowledge required. Deployed via `Vercel`, making deployment straightforward, fast, and with minimal learning curve.
- 🔮 **Simplicity**: Responsive layout for both mobile and PC. Custom 404 page. Clean and minimal design with selective content display on different devices.

# Roadmap

- ~~Responsive layout~~
- Comment system
- Traffic monitoring

# How to Use

1. Fork this repository and run it locally.
2. Use `YBG-cli` to delete all article files and write your own.
3. If you don't like the style, you can customize your own styles and animations.
4. Deploy your blog on `Vercel`.

> If you enjoy full-stack development, the Vercel website provides related databases and full-stack development tutorials.
