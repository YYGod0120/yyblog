It tells the story of a case eight years ago that provides ideas for a novel, but this novel seems to tell us that the case is not that simple and that someone has gone missing because of it.",
  "22": "The advantage is that it features a dual narrative, interweaving virtual and real elements. There are numerous puzzles from a third-party perspective, and there is a sense of immersion",
  "23": "The disadvantage is that the pace is slow, and most of the characters are engaged in conversation, which can be somewhat dull. Simple puzzle with few reversals"
